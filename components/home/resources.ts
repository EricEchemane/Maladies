            `Spray Milk for powdery mildew
                Milk is another fantastic alternative that will not cause harm to any beneficial insects or hummingbirds. When milk has contact with the sun, it creates an effective solution to treating powdery mildew. Using milk requires a solution of milk and water. There are many variations of recipes out there for what milk to water ratio is needed for the spray. The best estimation is using four parts milk to six parts water to effectively stop the powdery mildew. There is no word on whether the fat content or percentage of the milk makes any difference in effectiveness. Although worth noting, sour milk will work just as well as drinkable milk. So do not throw away that rotten milk; use it to treat the powdery mildew in your garden.`

            "Fill a spray bottle with warm water. Add milk and shake the bottle for a few seconds.",
            "Apply the spray on the top and bottom of the leaves affected by the powdery mildew.",
            "TIP: If you use sour or rotten milk, you may want to strain the milk before pouring it into the spray bottle to prevent the spray nozzle from clogging."

        title: "Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot",
        descriptions: [
            "Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.",
            "The fungus overwinters on infected tomato debris or on weeds in the nightshade family, the same family to which tomatoes belong. The fungus can also survive on equipment such as plant stakes and cages. Long periods of high relative humidity, temperatures of 60–80 degrees F, and leaf wetness are ideal conditions for development and spread of the pathogen."

            "Remove diseased leaves. If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. At the end of the season, collect all foliage from infected plants and dispose of or bury. Do not compost diseased plants.",
            "Improve air circulation around the plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage.",
            "Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.",
            "Do not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.",
            "Control weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.",
            "Use crop rotation. Next year do not plant tomatoes back in the same location where diseased tomatoes grew. Wait 1–2 years before replanting tomatoes in these areas.",
            "Use fungicidal sprays. If the above measures do not control the disease, you may want to use fungicidal sprays. Fungicides will not cure infected leaves, but they will protect new leaves from becoming infected. Apply at 7 to 10 day intervals throughout the season. Apply chlorothalonil, maneb, macozeb, or a copper-based fungicide, such as Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper sulfate, or copper oxychloride sulfate. Follow harvest restrictions listed on the pesticide label.",
